This Application should create a simulated forest. With each press on the space bar, a new object in form of a tree should be placed onto a floor area.

This project is an exercise during the computer graphics lecture in the Computer Science Bachelor class at the Hochschule Karlsruhe - Technik und Wirtschaft.
